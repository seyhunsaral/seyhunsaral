### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I am a postdoctoral researcher and the lab manager at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods.

My research is focused on the topic of cooperation, specifically on reciprocity and conditional cooperation. One particular application that I am interested in is social production goods such as open-source software, wikis, public guides and so on.

For my research, I use methods from microeconomics, game theory, behavioral and experimental economics, agent-based modelling and social choice theory.

I am also interested in software development related to experimental social sciences and data analysis.
